     *             * Why is there a delay here? *
     * Because after the MCU is initialized and started, 
     * maybe due to hardware reasons, 
     * it needs to wait for the clock to stabilize. 
     * The initialization is actually very fast, 
     * but the stabilization process is relatively long. 
     * You have no way of knowing if the SD card is already 
     * clock stabilized, even if it initializes normally 
     * and hangs normally on FATFS.
     * So I put a 500ms delay in this place, maybe it's too long, 
     * but it's enough to make sure it's stable
